## Table Time

Welcome to Table Time! This project was developed and programmed within a tight timeframe, so there may be some missing features. It serves as an initial prototype.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into three main folders:

1. **components**: Contains the individual components of the table.
2. **style**: Holds the styling files for the components.
3. **theme**: This folder is currently unused.

The core functionality of the project resides in the `table-time.tsx` file. This file gathers the components necessary for the table from the following files:

- `second-head.tsx`
- `first-head.tsx`
- `body-table.tsx`

Additionally, there is another folder dedicated to the Drag and Drop feature. Although it hasn't been implemented yet, it's planned for future development.
